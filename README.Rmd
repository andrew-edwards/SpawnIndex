## Description

Calculate the spawn index for Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasii) in British Columbia, Canada.
There are three types of spawn survey observations:
surface spawn, Macrocystis spawn, and understory spawn.
These calculations rely on an estimate of female fecundity to
convert the number of eggs to the spawn index (i.e., biomass).
In addition, we provide a method to estimate the biomass of fish from spawn-on-kelp (SOK) operations.
Note that the 'spawn index' is a relative index of spawning biomass.

## Installation

Install the SpawnIndex package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "grinnellm/SpawnIndex")
```

Note that the SpawnIndex package is not available on
[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

## Example

This example which shows how to calculate the conversion factor for
the number of Pacific Herring eggs to
the spawn index (i.e., biomass) in tonnes.

```{r example}
library(SpawnIndex)
data(pars)
theta <- calc_egg_conversion()
theta
```

Thus, we convert eggs to biomass in tonnes by
dividing the number of eggs by `r theta`.

## Additional information

The technical report has background information on the spawn index and calculations.
A draft technical report is available here: `./tr/Draft.pdf`.
**Please do not cite or circulate this draft.**
In addition, there is a vignette with an example workflow;
build the vignette

```{r vignette, eval = FALSE}
devtools::build_vignettes(pkg = ".")
```

and open the file `./doc/Introduction.html`.
