## Description

The SpawnIndex package provides data, parameter values, and methods to
calculate the spawn index for Pacific Herring (*Clupea pallasii*) in
British Columbia (BC), Canada. Essentially, spawn index calculations convert
spawn survey observations (e.g., spawn extent, number of egg layers,
substrate type) to the Pacific Herring spawn index in BC. There are three
types of spawn survey observations: surface spawn observations, Macrocystis
spawn observations, and understory spawn observations. In addition, we
include methods to convert eggs to biomass, and estimate spawning biomass in
spawn-on-kelp operations. Note that the 'spawn index' is a relative index of
spawning biomass.

## Installation

Install the SpawnIndex package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "grinnellm/SpawnIndex")
```

## Example

This example shows how we estimate
the biomass of Pacific Herring that spawned and produced eggs
which were removed from the population by a given spawn on kelp (SOK) fishery.
First, we calculate the conversion factor for the number of Pacific Herring eggs
to the spawn index (i.e., biomass) in tonnes, t.

```{r theta}
library(SpawnIndex)
data(pars)
theta <- calc_egg_conversion()
theta
```

Thus, we convert eggs to biomass in tonnes by
dividing the number of eggs by `r ifelse(theta == 1e+08, "10^8^", theta)`,
where `theta` is in units of 10^8^\ eggs\ t^-1^.
We use this conversion factor to estimate the biomass of
Pacific Herring that produced a given amount of SOK product in kilograms, kg.

```{r sok}
sok <- 100  # SOK product in kg
biomass <- calc_biomass_sok(SOK = sok, theta = theta)
biomass  # Spawning biomass in t
```

In this example, `r sok`\ kg of SOK product was produced by
`r format(biomass, digits = 3)`\ t of spawning Pacific Herring.
