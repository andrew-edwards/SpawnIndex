Description: Calculate the spawn index for Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasii) in
    British Columbia, Canada. There are three types of spawn survey
    observations: surface spawn, Macrocystis spawn, and understory spawn. These
    calculations rely on an estimate of female fecundity to convert the number
    of eggs to the spawn index (i.e., biomass). In addition, we provide a method
    to estimate the biomass of fish from spawn-on-kelp (SOK) operations. Note
    that the 'spawn index' is a relative index of spawning biomass.
Note: 32-bit R is required to get data from the 32-bit MS Access database.
