Description: The SpawnIndex package provides data, parameter values, and methods
    to calculate the spawn index for Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasii) in
    British Columbia (BC), Canada. Essentially, spawn index calculations convert
    spawn survey observations (e.g., spawn extent, number of egg layers,
    substrate type) to the Pacific Herring spawn index in BC. There are three
    types of spawn survey observations: surface spawn observations, Macrocystis
    spawn observations, and understory spawn observations. In addition, we
    include methods to convert eggs to biomass, and estimate spawning biomass in
    spawn-on-kelp operations. Note that the 'spawn index' is a relative index of
    spawning biomass.
Note: 32-bit R is required to get data from the 32-bit MS Access database.
