analysis, or NA to include all the Sections in the region.}

examples).}

\description{
Load Pacific Herring areas. Herring areas are kept in two files: the section
file has coarse area information, and location file has finer details. This
function merges these two files, and drops unnecessary rows and columns. In
addition, 'groups' are created for certain regions based on section numbers.
The output is a data frame with both coarse- and fine-scale area information
for the region(s) in question. There is an option to subset the sections if
desired.
}
\note{
This function requires 32-bit R to load data from the 32-bit MS Access
  database.
